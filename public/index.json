[{"categories":["security"],"contents":"What is a kernel stack call? The Linux kernel stack call, also known as the kernel stack trace, provides information about the sequence of function calls and their associated memory addresses that are currently executing in the kernel. It helps in understanding the execution flow and context within the kernel when certain events occur. Here is the information typically included in a Linux kernel stack call:\nMemory Addresses: The kernel stack call includes memory addresses, usually in hexadecimal format, representing the locations in memory where each function call resides. These addresses help identify the specific functions that are part of the call stack.\nFunction Names: In addition to memory addresses, the kernel stack call often includes the names of the functions involved in the call stack. These function names provide a more human-readable representation of the stack trace and help identify the specific functions involved in the execution flow.\nStack Frame Information: Each function call in the stack trace is associated with a stack frame, which includes information such as the function\u0026rsquo;s return address, input parameters, and local variables. The stack frame information helps reconstruct the execution context of each function in the call stack.\nExecution Order: The kernel stack call presents the sequence of function calls in the order they were executed, from the top of the call stack (most recent) to the bottom (earlier function calls). This order allows understanding the flow of execution and the path taken through the kernel code.\nNested Function Calls: The kernel stack call captures nested function calls, representing the hierarchy of function invocations. This information helps understand the relationships between different functions and the calling patterns within the kernel.\nContext Switches: The kernel stack call may also include information about context switches between different processes or threads. These switches can provide insights into the scheduling behavior of the kernel and the transition points between different execution contexts.\nThe Linux kernel stack call is a valuable source of information for debugging, performance analysis, and security investigations. It allows understanding the execution flow, identifying potential bottlenecks or issues, and gaining insights into the behavior of the kernel during specific events or system operations.\nHow can I use the kernel stack call in a detection rule? When developing a detection rule, you can utilize the kernel stack call as a valuable source of information to identify suspicious or malicious activity. The kernel stack call represents the sequence of function calls and their associated memory addresses currently executing in the kernel.\nTo use the kernel stack call in a detection rule, you can follow these steps:\nUnderstand the Kernel Stack Call: Familiarize yourself with the structure and format of the kernel stack call in the operating system you are working with. Different operating systems may have varying mechanisms for accessing the kernel stack call.\nDetermine Relevant Function Calls: Identify specific function calls or sequences of function calls that are indicative of the activity you want to detect. This could include known patterns associated with malware, privilege escalation, or other suspicious behaviors.\nLeverage System Utilities or APIs: Use system utilities or APIs provided by the operating system to retrieve the kernel stack call information. This may involve accessing specific kernel data structures or using system calls specifically designed for this purpose.\nDevelop Detection Rules: Utilize the information obtained from the kernel stack call to develop detection rules. This could involve pattern matching, anomaly detection, or correlation with other events or indicators. Your detection rules should trigger alerts or initiate actions when the specified conditions related to the kernel stack call are met.\nTest and Refine: Test your detection rules in a controlled environment to ensure they are accurately identifying the intended activity. Continuously refine your rules based on feedback and real-world observations.\nMonitor and Alert: Deploy your detection rules in your monitoring system to continuously monitor for the specified kernel stack call patterns. When a match is detected, generate alerts or notifications to initiate further investigation and response.\nRemember, working with the kernel stack call requires a deep understanding of the operating system\u0026rsquo;s internals, and modifying or accessing the kernel stack directly can be complex and potentially risky. Ensure you have the necessary expertise and consider the implications of interacting with critical system components before implementing detection rules based on the kernel stack call.\nhow can I collect the process stack call when a detection rule fires? Collecting the process stack call when a detection rule fires can be a valuable step in investigating and understanding the context of the detected activity. To collect the process stack call, you can follow these general steps:\nTrigger Event: Set up your detection rule to generate an event or trigger an action when the rule conditions are met. This could be an alert, log entry, or any other mechanism that signals the detection.\nIdentify Process Information: When the detection rule fires, obtain the necessary process information, such as the process ID (PID) or process name, associated with the triggered event. This information helps identify the specific process for which you want to collect the stack call.\nSelect Stack Trace Collection Method: Determine the appropriate method to collect the process stack call based on the operating system and tools available. Here are two common approaches:\na. Manual Inspection: If you have direct access to the system, you can attach a debugger to the process identified in step 2 and manually inspect the stack trace. Tools like GDB (GNU Debugger) on Linux or WinDbg on Windows allow you to interactively examine the stack frames and function calls.\nb. Automated Tooling: Utilize automated tools or APIs provided by the operating system or third-party libraries to collect the process stack trace programmatically. These tools often provide APIs or functions to capture the stack trace information, which can be integrated into your detection system or scripts.\nCollect Stack Trace: Implement the selected method to collect the stack trace for the identified process. This involves retrieving the memory addresses and function call information from the process\u0026rsquo;s stack frames.\nStore or Log the Stack Trace: Store the collected stack trace information in a format suitable for analysis and investigation. This could be a log entry, a separate file, or integration with a central logging system for further analysis.\nCorrelate and Analyze: Correlate the collected stack trace with the triggering event and any other relevant data. Analyze the stack trace to understand the execution flow, identify suspicious or malicious functions, or gain insights into the behavior of the process.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s worth noting that collecting the process stack call often requires elevated privileges and an understanding of debugging techniques. It\u0026rsquo;s important to ensure that you have the necessary permissions and expertise to interact with critical system components before attempting to collect stack traces.\nhow can I collect a kernel stack trace in a Linux machine? In Linux, there are several methods to collect a kernel stack trace. Here are a few common approaches:\nKprobes and SystemTap:\nKprobes allows you to dynamically instrument the kernel code and collect stack traces at specific breakpoints or events. SystemTap is a scripting language that utilizes Kprobes to collect data from the kernel, including stack traces. Ftrace:\nFtrace is a built-in Linux kernel framework for tracing and debugging. You can enable function tracing with stack traces to collect kernel stack traces. Use the trace-cmd command-line tool to enable and capture the stack traces. Crash Dumps:\nIf your Linux system encounters a kernel panic or crash, it generates a crash dump or core dump. Analyzing the crash dump with tools like crash or gdb can provide stack trace information at the time of the crash. Kernel Debuggers:\nTools like gdb and kgdb allow you to attach a debugger to a running kernel or a kernel that\u0026rsquo;s stopped due to a panic or crash. Once attached, you can collect stack traces and inspect the state of the kernel. Profiling Tools:\nProfiling tools such as perf or SystemTap can capture stack traces as part of their performance analysis capabilities. These tools can help identify hotspots and bottlenecks in the kernel code by collecting stack traces during profiling. It\u0026rsquo;s important to note that collecting kernel stack traces often requires administrative privileges and a good understanding of the kernel\u0026rsquo;s internals. Care should be taken when modifying or interacting with the kernel to avoid any unintended consequences. Additionally, the specific tools and methods available may vary depending on the Linux distribution and kernel version you are using.\nExample Certainly! Here\u0026rsquo;s an example of a Linux kernel stack trace that includes input parameters and local variables:\n[\u0026lt;ffffffff8107a0ba\u0026gt;] do_sys_open+0x13a/0x1e0 [\u0026lt;ffffffff8107a1af\u0026gt;] __x64_sys_openat+0x5f/0x90 [\u0026lt;ffffffff8107a1fb\u0026gt;] do_syscall_64+0x4b/0xc0 [\u0026lt;ffffffff8180809b\u0026gt;] entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xa9 Let\u0026rsquo;s break it down:\nThe first entry (do_sys_open+0x13a/0x1e0) refers to the do_sys_open function at memory address 0xffffffff8107a0ba. The offset +0x13a/0x1e0 indicates the relative position within the function.\nThe second entry (__x64_sys_openat+0x5f/0x90) points to the __x64_sys_openat function at 0xffffffff8107a1af. The offset +0x5f/0x90 provides the relative position.\nThe third entry (do_syscall_64+0x4b/0xc0) corresponds to the do_syscall_64 function at 0xffffffff8107a1fb. The offset +0x4b/0xc0 indicates the relative position within the function.\nThe fourth entry (entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xa9) represents the entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe function at 0xffffffff8180809b. The offset +0x44/0xa9 provides the relative position.\nPlease note that this is a simplified example, and the stack trace content can vary depending on the specific context and functions involved. In a real-world scenario, you would typically see input parameters and local variables along with their respective values listed within each function call in the stack trace, providing more detailed information about the function\u0026rsquo;s execution.\ncan I get a kernel stack trace after the process has terminated? No, it is not possible to obtain a kernel stack trace after a process has terminated. When a process exits, its kernel stack is deallocated and no longer accessible. Therefore, you cannot retrieve the kernel stack trace associated with a terminated process.\nThe kernel stack trace contains information about the function calls and execution flow of a process within the kernel. It is maintained while the process is active and its kernel thread is executing. Once the process terminates, the kernel stack associated with that process is cleaned up and cannot be accessed anymore.\nTo collect a kernel stack trace, you need to capture it while the process is still running or at a specific breakpoint or event during the process\u0026rsquo;s execution. Once the process has terminated, the kernel stack trace of that process is no longer available for retrieval.\nIf you need to investigate issues related to a terminated process, you can analyze any available logs, core dumps, or other diagnostic information generated during the process\u0026rsquo;s execution. These resources may provide insights into the behavior of the process and help in troubleshooting the cause of the termination.\n","date":"May 28, 2023","hero":"/images/default-hero.jpg","permalink":"https://ardroci.pages.dev/posts/detections/linux/kernel-stack/","summary":"What is a kernel stack call?

It is a snapshot of the process\u0026rsquo;s memory at the time of the crash, including the values of variables, registers, and other relevant data. When a program crashes or terminates abnormally due to an error, the operating system generates a core dump file to help in debugging and understanding the cause of the crash. This file contains valuable information that can be analyzed to diagnose the issue and fix the software or identify vulnerabilities.\nThe core dump file is typically written to disk in a binary format but it can also be passed to a helper program (such as systemd-coredump(8)) for further processing. It contains the memory image of the crashed process and includes the program\u0026rsquo;s code, stack frames, heap data, and other relevant information. By examining the core dump, developers and security professionals can gain insights into the state of the program at the time of the crash, helping them identify bugs, memory corruption issues, or security vulnerabilities.\nTo analyze a core dump file, various debugging tools and techniques can be used. These tools allow the examination of memory regions, registers, and stack frames to understand the flow of the program before it crashed. Debuggers like GDB (GNU Debugger) are commonly used to load the core dump file and perform detailed analysis, including inspecting variables, stepping through the code, and examining memory regions.\nSecurity detection engineers may utilize core dumps as part of their investigations when analyzing incidents related to software crashes, exploits, or malicious activities. By examining the core dump, they can gather crucial information about the exploit or identify potential vulnerabilities that were exploited.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s worth noting that core dumps may contain sensitive information, such as passwords or encryption keys, depending on the state of the crashed process. Therefore, it\u0026rsquo;s important to handle core dump files with care, restrict access to authorized personnel, and ensure they are securely stored to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.\nExploring Threat Actor Exploitation of Core Dumps In general, a core dump file itself does not pose a direct risk when it comes to threat actors using it maliciously. However, threat actors can potentially leverage the information contained within a core dump to aid in their attacks or exploit vulnerabilities. Here are a few scenarios where a threat actor might find value in a core dump:\nInformation Disclosure: If the core dump file contains sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, or cryptographic keys, a threat actor could analyze the dump to extract and exploit that data.\nExploit Analysis: By examining a core dump, threat actors can gain insights into the inner workings of a crashed process. They can analyze the memory contents to identify vulnerabilities, memory corruption issues, or other weaknesses that could be exploited for their malicious activities.\nReverse Engineering: A threat actor may use a core dump file to reverse engineer the software and understand its internal structure, algorithms, or proprietary protocols. This knowledge can be leveraged to craft more sophisticated attacks or develop exploits targeting specific vulnerabilities.\nDebugging Exploits: Core dumps provide detailed information about the state of a crashed process, including register values, stack traces, and memory contents. Threat actors can use this information to debug their exploits, fine-tune their attack techniques, or identify potential weaknesses to bypass security measures.\nTo mitigate the risks associated with core dumps falling into the wrong hands, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to follow security best practices:\nRestrict Access: Limit access to core dump files to authorized personnel only. Implement strict access controls, permissions, and user authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access.\nSecure Storage: Store core dump files in a secure location with proper encryption and access controls. Regularly monitor and audit access to these files to detect any suspicious activities.\nSanitize Sensitive Data: Before sharing or analyzing core dump files, ensure sensitive information, such as passwords or encryption keys, is removed or obfuscated to prevent potential exploitation.\nIncident Response: If a core dump is part of a security incident, follow established incident response procedures. Analyze the core dump in a controlled environment and take appropriate actions to remediate vulnerabilities, patch software, or enhance security controls.\nBy understanding the potential risks and taking appropriate security measures, organizations can help minimize the chances of threat actors exploiting core dump files for their malicious activities.\nUnveiling Threat Actor Techniques: How They Force Core Dumps In the realm of cybersecurity, threat actors continuously devise new methods to achieve their malicious objectives. One technique they may employ is to force a core dump on a targeted system. A core dump is a snapshot of a process\u0026rsquo;s memory at the time of its abnormal termination or crash. In this blog post, we will explore how threat actors can force core dumps and the potential risks associated with these actions.\nMethod 1: Exploiting Vulnerabilities One common approach utilized by threat actors involves exploiting software vulnerabilities. By identifying weaknesses in applications or the underlying operating system, they can trigger crashes or abnormal terminations intentionally. Vulnerabilities such as memory corruption, buffer overflow, or programming errors may serve as entry points. Through targeted exploitation, threat actors can force a process to crash, ultimately leading to the generation of a core dump.\nMethod 2: Resource Exhaustion Another technique is to exhaust system resources deliberately. By overwhelming a specific process or the system as a whole, threat actors can cause a crash scenario. Excessive consumption of memory, CPU, or other critical resources can result in an abnormal termination, triggering the creation of a core dump.\nMethod 3: Signal Injection Threat actors may manipulate vulnerable applications to generate specific signals, such as the SIGSEGV (segmentation fault) signal. This signal, when injected, causes a process to terminate abruptly. By exploiting the application\u0026rsquo;s vulnerability to signal injection, threat actors can induce a crash scenario and prompt the system to generate a core dump.\nMethod 4: Debugging Tools Abuse If a threat actor gains unauthorized access to a system or compromises a privileged account, they may abuse debugging tools that allow core dump generation. Debuggers like GDB (GNU Debugger) or similar utilities can be misused to force crashes, intercept signals, or manipulate the target process\u0026rsquo;s behavior. Through such manipulation, threat actors can trigger core dump creation.\nMitigation Strategies To effectively eradicate the threat associated with core dump files falling into the wrong hands, it is important to implement a combination of preventive measures and incident response practices. Here are some steps you can take:\nAccess Controls: Implement strong access controls to restrict access to core dump files. Only authorized personnel should have permission to access and analyze these files. Regularly review and update access privileges to ensure they align with the principle of least privilege.\nSecure Storage and Encryption: Store core dump files in a secure location, such as a dedicated and protected directory or server, with proper encryption in place. Encryption adds an extra layer of protection, especially if the files are stored or transferred over untrusted networks.\nData Sanitization: Before sharing or analyzing core dump files, ensure sensitive data within the dumps, such as passwords, keys, or personally identifiable information (PII), is removed or obfuscated. This can be achieved by scrubbing or sanitizing the dumps using appropriate tools or techniques.\nIncident Response Planning: Develop a comprehensive incident response plan specifically tailored to address incidents involving core dump files. This plan should outline the steps to be taken when a core dump is compromised or potentially accessed by unauthorized parties.\nMonitoring and Detection: Implement robust monitoring and detection mechanisms to identify any unauthorized access attempts or suspicious activities related to core dump files. This can include intrusion detection systems, log analysis, and security event monitoring.\nRegular Auditing and Review: Conduct regular audits and reviews of the access logs, storage locations, and security measures related to core dump files. This helps ensure that security controls are functioning as intended and any vulnerabilities or misconfigurations are promptly addressed.\nEmployee Awareness and Training: Provide training and awareness programs to employees involved in handling core dump files. Educate them about the importance of securing and handling these files properly, including the risks associated with their exposure and the best practices to mitigate those risks.\nThreat Detection Rules Rather than emphasizing commands that generate core dumps, shift your focus to the list of signals that trigger core dump creation in a process, e.g. SIGABRT. [2, 3]. However, not all monitoring tools are equipped to handle such intricate levels of detail. As an alternative, you can consider /proc/self/coredump_filter. The /proc/self/coredump_filter file is used in Linux systems to control the types of information that are included in a core dump file when a process crashes. It allows a process to specify which memory segments and resources should be included or excluded from the core dump. Before generating the core dump, the operating system checks the settings in the /proc/self/coredump_filter file to determine which memory segments and resources should be included in the core dump, e.g. openat(AT_FDCWD, \u0026ldquo;/proc/1688715/coredump_filter\u0026rdquo;, O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 14. The operating system reads the bitmask specified in the file to understand the process\u0026rsquo;s preferences for the contents of the core dump. Based on the settings in the coredump_filter file, the operating system includes or excludes the corresponding memory segments and resources when creating the core dump file.\nAuditd To detect when a process reads its own core dump filter settings, we will leverage the power of auditd, the Linux auditing framework. Follow these steps to create the FIM rule:\nOpen the audit rules configuration file using a text editor: sudo nano /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules Add the following line to the file: -w /proc/self/coredump_filter -p r -k coredump_filter_read This rule instructs auditd to monitor the file /proc/self/coredump_filter for read operations (-p r). When a process reads this file, an audit event will be generated and labeled with the key coredump_filter_read (-k coredump_filter_read). 3. Save the file and exit the text editor.\nRestart the auditd service to apply the changes: sudo service auditd restart Falco Falco is a powerful open-source cloud-native runtime security tool that enables real-time threat detection and response. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example of a Falco rule that can detect when a process reads the /proc/self/coredump_filter file:\nOpen the falco rules configuration file using a text editor: sudo nano /etc/falco/falco_rules.local.yaml Add the following macro and rule to the file: - macro: open_read condition: (evt.type in (open,openat,openat2) and evt.is_open_read=true and fd.typechar=\u0026#39;f\u0026#39; and fd.num\u0026gt;=0) - rule: Core dump desc: \u0026gt; An attempt to read core dump. enabled: true condition: \u0026gt; evt.category=file and open_read and fd.name = \u0026#34;/proc/self/coredump_filter\u0026#34; output: | # Event information evt_rawres=%evt.rawres, evt_type=%evt.type, evt_dir=%evt.dir, syscall_type=%syscall.type, evt_category=%evt.category, evt_args=%evt.args, # Process information proc_pid=%proc.pid, proc_exe=%proc.exe, proc_name=%proc.name, proc_args=%proc.args, proc_cmdline=%proc.cmdline, proc_exeline=%proc.exeline, proc_cwd=%proc.cwd, proc_nthreads=%proc.nthreads, proc_nchilds=%proc.nchilds, proc_ppid=%proc.ppid, proc_pname=%proc.pname, proc_pcmdline=%proc.pcmdline, proc_apid_2=%proc.apid[2], proc_aname_2=%proc.aname[2], proc_apid_3=%proc.apid[3], proc_aname_3=%proc.aname[3], proc_apid_4=%proc.apid[4], proc_aname_4=%proc.aname[4], proc_loginshellid=%proc.loginshellid, proc_duration=%proc.duration, proc_fdopencount=%proc.fdopencount, proc_vmsize=%proc.vmsize, proc_sid=%proc.sid, proc_sname=%proc.sname, proc_tty=%proc.tty, proc_exepath=%proc.exepath, proc_vpgid=%proc.vpgid, proc_is_exe_writable=%proc.is_exe_writable, # Threat information #thread_cap_permitted=%thread.cap_permitted, thread_cap_inheritable=%thread.cap_inheritable, thread_cap_effective=%thread.cap_effective, # File descriptor information fd_num=%fd.num, fd.type=%fd.type, fd_name=%fd.name, # User and group information user_uid=%user.uid, user_name=%user.name, user_homedir=%user.homedir, user_shell=%user.shell, user_loginuid=%user.loginuid, user_loginname=%user.loginname, group_gid=%group.gid, group_name=%group.name priority: WARNING tags: [filesystem, mitre_credential_access, mitre_discovery] Save the file and exit the text editor.\nRestart the falco service to apply the changes:\nsudo service falco restart Note: Make sure to configure Falco properly to ensure it captures the necessary system events and performs the desired detection. Adjust the rule according to your specific environment and monitoring needs.\nValidation Once you have implemented a FIM rule to detect process access to the /proc/self/coredump_filter file, it is essential to verify that the detection logic is functioning correctly. In this section, we will walk you through the steps to test the detection logic of the rule and ensure that it generates the expected output when a process reads the core dump filter file.\nStep 1: Preparing the Environment Before testing the rule, ensure that you have Falco or auditd properly installed and running on your system. Refer to the Falco documentation for guidance on installation and configuration specific to your environment.\nStep 2: Performing the Test To test the detection logic, execute the following commands:\nsleep 300 \u0026amp; PID=$! kill -s SIGSEGV \u0026#34;$PID\u0026#34; By following these steps, you can test the detection logic of your rule and validate its effectiveness in detecting access . Regularly testing and validating your security monitoring rules is crucial to ensure that your system remains protected against unauthorized or suspicious activities.\nBed Time Reading https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Core_dump https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/core.5.html https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/signal.7.html https://linux-audit.com/understand-and-configure-core-dumps-work-on-linux/#disable-core-dumps ","date":"May 28, 2023","hero":"/posts/detections/linux/detection-core-dumps/password-with-hand-holding-tweezers-binary-code.jpg","permalink":"https://ardroci.pages.dev/posts/detections/linux/detection-core-dumps/","summary":"Unveiling the Secrets of Linux Core Dumps A Linux core dump, also known as a core dump file, is a file that captures the memory contents of a running process when it encounters a critical error or crashes.
